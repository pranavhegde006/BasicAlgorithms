# BasicAlgorithms

These are some of the basic algorithms that I have coded in Python and C.

Many ciphers are yet under develpment.
tse_trigocipher.py is a proprietary time specific trigonometric cipher that I have devised on my own.
there are various versions of hill ciphers in the open source directory. One is the substitution based time specific hill cipher and the other one is the ASCII based hill cipher.
I have included the source code of the RSA and Caesar cipher too. 
Hope you enjoy it! 
Stay tuned for more
